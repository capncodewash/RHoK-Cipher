RHoK-Cipher is a demonstrator for a cryptography education project. It is aimed at children aged 8 to 16, and attempts to provide an engaging way to teach the fundamental principles of cryptography.

The authors of the system intend it to include material on the following topics:
* Substitution ciphers
* The Playfair cipher
* The 'Battleships' cipher
* Diffie-Hellman key exchange
* One-time pads
* Steganography using images

RHoK-Cipher extends an existing cryptography learning environment with an exciting storyline involving espionage, intrigue and character development. It also improves upon the existing project in terms of ease-of-use, information design and in providing for a variety of learning styles.

RHoK-Cipher was developed at the [Random Hacks of Kindness Glasgow Cybersecurity Special Event ](http://scotlandhacks.org.uk/content/rhok-glasgow-cybersecurity-special-event-2013), 7th-8th September 2013.
